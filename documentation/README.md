## ï¿½ Workflow Generation Feature Improvements

### Connecting to the Actual Database for Form Schemas

Currently, forms are loaded from a dummy database (AWS S3 bucket). To enhance the workflow generation feature, update the `workflow_generation.py` so that it loads JSON schemas for each form directly from the actual database containing the form schemas, instead of the dummy S3 bucket.

### Supporting Other Workflow Actions

To further improve workflow generation for actions such as data access and notifications, you can create reference JSON files for each workflow type (e.g., data access, notifications) and pass these reference files to the LLM. This will help the LLM generate more accurate and context-aware workflows based on the specific action required.

**Summary of Steps:**

- Connect `workflow_generation.py` to the actual database containing JSON schemas for forms.
- For other workflow actions (like data access), create and maintain reference JSON files in the `workflow_reference` folder.
- Pass the relevant reference JSON and user request to the LLM for improved workflow generation.

### 1. AWS Setup

1. **Create an IAM user** in AWS.
2. **Assign permissions:**
   - Grant `AdministratorAccess` (or at least `AmazonBedrockFullAccess`).
3. **Create an access key** for the IAM user and securely store the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

### 2. Environment Setup

#### a) Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Amazon Access Key Here>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Amazon Secret Access Key Here>
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

#### b) Backend Setup

```sh
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### c) Reference Schemas & System Prompts

- Add the form reference schema (`All_fields.json`) to the `form_reference` folder (already present).
- Add the workflow reference schema to the `workflow_reference` folder.
- Add the appropriate `system_prompt.txt` to both `form_reference` and `workflow_reference` folders.
- The system prompt, reference JSON, and user request are passed to the LLM.

#### d) Run the Backend Server

```sh
cd backend
flask run
```

#### e) Run the Frontend Server

```sh
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
